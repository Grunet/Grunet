# High-Level Interests

## Web Accessibility

- Making things as simple as possible for "average Joe" designers, developers, product managers, etc... to readily understand the experiences of people with disabilities, to the point where there's no viable economic argument for not making products accessible.

## Testing

- Minimizing regressions while spending the least amount of effort possible doing so
- Evaluating and understanding the level of safety a test suite provides against regressions
- Practicing software testing against simulations or "recordings" of rapidly changing real-world products
