# My Interests

## Web Accessibility

- Ways for things to be made as simple as possible for "average Joe" designers, developers, product managers, etc... to readily understand the experiences of people with disabilities, to the point where there's no viable economic argument for not doing so.

## Testing

- Ways to minimize regressions (while spending the least amount of effort possible doing so)
- Ways to evaluate and understand the level of safety a test suite provides against regressions
- Ways to practice software testing against simulations or "recordings" of rapidly changing real-world products
