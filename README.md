# High-Level Interests

## Web Accessibility

- Making things as simple as possible for every researcher, designer, developer, product manager, etc... to readily understand the experiences of disabled people, leaving no viable economic argument for not making products accessible.

## Observability

- Making it as easy as possible for engineers to ask arbitrary questions of the humans, code, and infrastructure comprising the sociotechnical systems they are responsible for

## Testing

- Deriving automated test coverage from production telemetry
- Minimizing regressions while spending the least amount of effort possible doing so
- Evaluating and understanding the level of safety a test suite provides against regressions
- Finding ways to practice software testing against simulations or "recordings" of rapidly changing real-world products
